Early history[]
The college awarded its first degrees in 1849. As it grew under the presidency of Sorin and his successors, new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate the growing student and faculty population. The brief presidency of Patrick Dillon (1865–1866) saw the original main building replaced with a larger one, which housed the university's administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Under 's first administration, enrollment at Notre Dame increased to over 500 students. In 1869, he opened the , which offered a two-year course of study, and in 1871 he began construction of Sacred Heart Church, today the . Two years later,  started a library in the Main Building, which had 10,000 volumes by 1879.

Fire destroyed the Main Building and the library collection in April 1879; the school closed immediately and students were sent home. Sorin (then provincial Superior) and President Corby immediately planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the entire university. Construction began on May 17, and by the incredible zeal of administrators and workers,  was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was rebuilt and housed in the new Main Building.
